# TBmodel
The stochastic IBM for TB transmission in Sarawak, Malaysia is implemented in /ibm/ibm/. Compiling the model requires a version of [Boost libraries](https://www.boost.org/) to be installed in the root directiory, the version of which should be specified in .vscode/task.json if using Visual Studios Code.

Outputs are generated by files in /ibm/exp/ and requires the compiled model in this location, unless manually specified otherwise.
