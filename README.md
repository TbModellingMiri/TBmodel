# TBmodel
This repository contains the stochastic IBM used to analyse TB transmission in Miri, Sarawak. The model is implemented in ibm/ibm. Compiling the model requires a version of [Boost libraries](https://www.boost.org/) to be installed in the root directiory (the original version of the model used boost version 1.82.0. If another version of boost is used, this should be specified in .vscode/task.json if using Visual Studios Code).

Outputs are generated by files in ibm/exp/ and requires the compiled model in this location, unless manually specified otherwise.

Due to the sensitive nature of this project, some data files could not be made public to this reposityr. A generate_synthetica_data.R script has been provided. Files generated with this script should be placed in ibm/ibm/data and ibm/exp/data.
